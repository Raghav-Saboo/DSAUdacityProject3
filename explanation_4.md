Active Directory

- Design
    - A tree is used to represent all the groups and users in a group.
- Time Complexity
    - O(n) since in the worst case we will traverse the entire tree for
      searching if the user is present where n is the number of nodes in the
      tree.
- Space Complexity
    - O(n) if there are total n nodes in the tree.
