Dutch National Flag Problem

- Design
    - Use a single traversal to sort the array. We can use multiple index
      pointers for 0, 1 and 2 and then iterate over the list updating the values
      of these pointers and updating the list as well.
- Time Complexity
    - O(n) as we are traversing the list only once.
- Space Complexity
    - O(1)
