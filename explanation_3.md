Rearrange Array Elements

- Design
    - Merge sort is used for sorting, and then we iterate over the sorted list
      to find the two numbers. After sorting the list we can pick alternate
      index values for each of the two numbers to maximise their sum.
- Time Complexity
    - O(nlog(n))
- Space Complexity
    - O(n)
