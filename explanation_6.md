Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists

- Design
    - We convert the linked list to set and then use the union and set
      intersection methods.
- Time Complexity
    - O(n) where n is the total number of nodes in both the linked list.
- Space Complexity
    - O(n) where n is the total number of nodes in both the linked list.
