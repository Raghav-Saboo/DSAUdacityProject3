File Recursion

- Design
    - Recursion is used to find all the subdirectory and files within a given
      directory.
- Time Complexity
    - O(n) if there are total n files and subdirectory in a given directory.
- Space Complexity
    - O(n) if there are n files which match the suffix since we store the paths
      of all those n files.
